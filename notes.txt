- From an image you can run an instance of the container.
- A container only lives as long as the process inside it is alive.
- If you run an image that is not running any services, it will stop immediately.
- 
Commands:

docker run <nameOfImage> => runs a container from the specified image, you wont be able to run commands until its stopped

docker run -d <nameOfImage> => runs the container in detached mode, you will get back to prompt

docker ps => shows a list of all running containers

docker ps -a => shows a list of all running or stopped containers

docker stop <nameOfContainer> => stops the specific container, run docker ps to see the name of the container

docker rm <nameOfContainer> => removes a container

docker images => see a list of all the images existing on the host

docker rmi <nameOfImage> => remove an image from the host. Make sure that you dont have
                            any containers running that runs of the image.
                            You must delete all the dependant containers to remove the image.

docker pull <nameOfImage> => pull the image so that you dont have to download it when 
                             whenever you want to run it.   


Execute a command when running a container:

docker run <nameOfImage> sleep 5 => when the container starts, it runs the command, goes to sleep for 5 seconds
                                    and then stops.

docker exec <nameOfContainer> sleep 5 => run a command on a running container

continue @ 30:00
